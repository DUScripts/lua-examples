# Official Dual Universe Lua Repository

_**Warning: If you found this github before we announced it publicly ... well bravo! Don't hesitate to starred it.**_
_**We are currently preparing the readmes and reworking the scripts slightly to make sure we expose clean and functional example scripts for the official github announcement.**_


## About Dual Universe
Dual Universe is a sci-fi MMORPG that takes place in a continuous, single-shard world. Players can freely modify the world by creating structures, spaceships, and even orbital stations, giving birth to empires and civilizations. It features a player-driven economy, politics, trade, and warfare.

Dual Universe is currently in open Beta, with a final release planned for 2022.

## About this repository
This repository has been created to serve as a sharing and learning platform for the Dual Universe community and the development of simple and complex Lua applications.

You will find on this repo the examples released by Novaquark in devblogs and other announcements of features along with other snippets we deem useful for the community.

#### Reminder: As the Lua feature evolves regularly, it is possible that a script or system may be broken or contain bugs. We will try to update the relevant examples if this is the case, but no guarantee of functionality can be given.

## How to use it ?
Each example provided here consists of the following:
 - A description of the example.
 - An image representing the result (if possible).
 - A list of requirements (which elements/links are needed to use the system).
 - Installation instructions.

In order to ensure the readability of the code, and to cover as many cases as possible, we have decided to organise the code into files by filters. Also in some cases, when the examples are simple and small, we have decided to group them together to reduce clutter.

Thus you will find in the examples folder Lua files named according to the convention `<slot>_<filter><index>`. 

For example:
 - `render.lua` : code for the Lua screen
 - `system_start.lua` : code for the `start` filter of the `system` slot
 - `system_update.lua`: code for the `update` filter in the `system` slot
 - `unit_tick1.lua` : code for the first `tick` filter in the `unit` slot
 - ...etc


Then, by following the instructions given, you can install these as required.
