### Description

This screen allows you to display information about the stellar bodies in the Helios system. This is a concrete example of the use of all the previous examples

### Requirements

  - A screen unit
### Installation
- For the screen unit part:
  - Place the screen unit.
  - Copy and paste the [render.lua](render.lua) into the screen content in Lua mode.

Optionnal: You can try to connect a programming board to it and send in input the player position to display the distance to the stellar body in its properties ;)
